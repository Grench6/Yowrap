# Yowrap

What you like the most about Yolo_mark?... Nothing? Me neither. Why? Because it is *soo slooow*.

Do not missunderstand me, it is time-consuming to create a descent tagging tool, but instead of creating a whole new tool I decided to create a simple Java wrapper, so I could convert the CSV files generated by my favorite tagging tool into those files supported by darknet in the trainning of Yolo models.

I highly recommend using **[VoTT](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT)** since it is fast and stable, but if you hate Microsoft you can use any other... as long as they generate a csv file like the one shown bellow:

*Test-export.csv*
```
"image","xmin","ymin","xmax","ymax","label"
"test_00000000.jpg",581.7152961980548,325.0117924528302,690.3625110521663,618.2193396226415,"apple"
"test_00000001.jpg",553.42175066313,305.76650943396226,710.7338638373121,626.1438679245283,"pen"
"test_00000002.jpg",553.42135466316,308.76650943396231,710.7338633463474,566.1438679245124,"apple-pen"
[...]
```

If your tagging tool does not generate the *exact* same files as the above, you can easily modify the source code to adjust the differences.

So, if you are using VoTT there is almost not need for you to modify the source, just download the `wrapper.jar` and then execute it like this: `java -jar wrapper.jar [.csv FILE] [output DIRECTORY] [-copy]`. If you execute it without arguments, it should print more help.
