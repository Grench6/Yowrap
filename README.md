# Yowrap

What you like the most about Yolo_mark?... Nothing? Me neither. Why? Because it is *soo slooow*.

Do not missunderstand me, it is time-consuming to create a decent tagging tool, but instead of creating a whole new tool I decided to create a simple Java wrapper, so I could convert the CSV files generated by my favorite tagging tool into those files supported by darknet in the trainning of Yolo models.

I highly recommend using **[VoTT](https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT)** since it is fast and stable, but if you hate Microsoft you can use any other... as long as they generate a csv file like the one shown bellow:

*Test-export.csv*
```
"image","xmin","ymin","xmax","ymax","label"
"test_00000000.jpg",581.7152961980548,325.0117924528302,690.3625110521663,618.2193396226415,"apple"
"test_00000001.jpg",553.42175066313,305.76650943396226,710.7338638373121,626.1438679245283,"pen"
"test_00000002.jpg",553.42135466316,308.76650943396231,710.7338633463474,566.1438679245124,"apple-pen"
[...]
```

If your tagging tool does not generate the *exact* same files as the above, you can easily modify the source code to adjust the differences.

So, if you are using VoTT there is almost not need for you to modify the source, just download the lastest release and you are good to go.
## Usage

`java -jar wrapper.jar [.csv FILE] [output DIRECTORY] [-copy]`

- The images MUST be located in the same directory as the .csv file.

- The output directory (usually the darknet directory) is optional: If it is specified, metadata files will be genereated; 
If it is not specified, no metadata files will be generated, and all yolo-coordinates files will be written to the same directory from where the images where read.

- By default, the program does not copy the images to the output dir, since it can take many time (in large datasets), and so the user has to manually copy them later. However, if you would like the program to include the images in the output dir, you can specify the "-copy" option at the end of the command.
